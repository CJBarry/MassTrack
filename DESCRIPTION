Title: Track Particle Mass along Calculated Pathlines in Groundwater
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Christopher Barry
Maintainer: Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: Designed as a post-processor to MODPATH, this package is a
    model for tracking particle mass along a calculated set of pathlines by
    analysing the flow balance of each cell through which the particles
    pass.  The code takes advantage of quick subsetting with the data.table
    package and NetCDF format for MODFLOW data provided by the Rflow
    package.
